# uCal

## Description

Tired of each semester having to enter your MyCampus schedule into your
google calendar?

Have you gotten so annoyed that now you take a screen shot and
constantly have to look at a picture that tells you where you need to
be and when?

This project provides a solution to the problem by gathering your
schedule from MyCampus and creating google calendar events. It even
takes into consideration those weird days that a friday schedule is on
a Monday as well as any Holidays.

Scheduling your time just got a whole lot easier.

Enjoy!
